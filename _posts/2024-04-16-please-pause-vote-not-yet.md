title: Please pause - vote "not yet"
---

I urge you please reconsider. If you all vote "not today," Disney has to
reconsider their contributions, specifically for housing. Please
consider the poverty Disney will create in our City. See the disturbing
statistics from Disney as an employer [linked
here](https://www.oxy.edu/sites/default/files/assets/UEPI/ert-disneyland-final2.pdf).
Make them come back to the negotiation table and include ongoing
contributions for affordable housing given that this project will
significantly increase the need for the already woefully low supply of
affordable units since they do not pay living wages to the large
majority of their staff. Please pause and make it so that the people who
work here can live here, including Disney staff.
