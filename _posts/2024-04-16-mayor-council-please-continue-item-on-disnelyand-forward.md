Mayor Aitken and City Councilmembers,

I urge you to motion and vote for a continuance on agenda item 14 on
Disneyland Forward this evening. This is a monumental decision for the
City of Anaheim, its businesses and residents. It is clear from public
displays of concern that there are substantive items still to be
understood, and with the continuing cloud of corruption that has plagued
our City over the past several years, it behooves the Council to slow
down. Below are essential elements that are not quite clear and need
greater exploration and time:

<!--more-->

1.  The importance of publicly engaging with residents on what a
    substantive and meaningful community benefits package should consist
    of. The \$30 million in affordable housing fund seems substantial
    but as calculated by city staff this amounts to approximately 60
    housing units--in our city wherein there over 15,000 households
    living with rent burden and one or two paychecks away from
    homelessness per the City's Housing Element. While the \$30 million
    can be leveraged to attract state and federal dollars, it is
    important to note these are still public dollars having to be
    utilized to house a private workforce that is not likely not be paid
    wages that they can afford to live on in Anaheim. As it does not
    appear that any of you have hosted or participated in community
    forums specifically on this generational decision within your
    respective districts I urge you to pause and host community
    conversations with your constituents--a practice Denis Barnes and I
    found especially helpful in the now infamous Stadium negotiations of
    2019 and Mayor Tait conducted in 2013.

2.  The City should expect and receive a commitment from Disney that new
    temporary and permanent jobs, which seem to be in the thousands,
    will not incur or contribute further to the City's poverty rates
    thus requiring greater City, School and public dollars to mitigate.
    While Disney's projections, and repeated over and over by the City
    PIO, that millions of dollars in additional revenues are expected
    from Disneyland Forward expansion, there is no analysis yet or at
    least not made public, of what the costs are for our City, County,
    and Schools to provide additional services and supports for a
    workforce/jobs that do not pay liveable wages in Anaheim and
    surrounding cities. As a reference, while we point to the millions
    in revenue the City has receives due to the 1996 Disney expansion,
    few mention that poverty rates in Anaheim overall and for Children
    in Anaheim are in fact higher today than they were in 1996. So while
    revenues certainly increased in the millions, so did the poverty of
    our City thus requiring more from our budgets. So I urge you to
    commission a cost/benefit analysis of projected new jobs, revenues
    and the wages and housing needs of the projected workforce including
    social services, school supports and health conditions.

3.  Despite your work over this past year to tackle the culture of
    corruption documented in the FBI investigations and ensuing JPL
    report, there is still a dark cloud that hovers over these
    proceedings. There has not been any meaningful actions of
    accountability taken by the Council as it relates to the behavior of
    executive leadership in the corruption scandal. Lastly, the
    applicant this evening, Disney Corp, was named in the JPL report as
    a meaningful contributor to the culture of corruption in our City,
    and refused to participate in the \$1.5 million

City investigation or offer any of its staff to respond to the role they
played in the workings of the self- proclaimed "cabal". It is imperative
that this matter be addressed as the City moves to build trust as well
as for the Disney Corp. to be trusted in its representations of what is
good for our City and residents.

To close, for many of us the process and now proposal put forth for
Disneyland Forward feels eerily similar to past experiences with large
corporate interests in our City. As a Mayor and Council, you are our
only line of protection from being taking advantage of as a City, you
are the negotiators trusted to look after the welfare of our City and
residents. Disney will do what's best, first and foremost for their
shareholders, that is their priority- -we ask you to prioritize fully
the residents of Anaheim who've entrusted you to clean up City Hall,
assure transparency and full community engagement, and to provide the
balance we so need from the greed that has too often consumed our City's
politics and priorities.

Please do discuss the proposal tonite, take in ideas, propose stronger
benefits, but please do not vote on this item tonite. A public hearing
is to hear the public, take time to consider the full input and come
back to then vote. Please continue this item and host forums in your
respective districts to allow substantive input from your constituents.

With appreciation,

 Jose M.
