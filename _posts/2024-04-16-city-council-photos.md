**Did Anaheim elected officials LISTEN to their concerned residents? You
decide!**

On April 16, 2024, the Anaheim City Council held a public hearing to
approve the DisneyForward proposal. Disney workers and staff took seats
in the Council Chamber. Local residents waited outside in the windy cold
night for a turn to voice their concerns. But when it's their turn, were

Natalie Rubalcava would rather have a side chat during a resident's
public statement. Long live Anaheim democracy!
