title: Public comment for May 7th meeting

Thank you for taking the time to read my comment, I just wanted to
preface this with that I am a cast member and have been for over 10
years. I want to speak on how easy it is for Disney to get what they
want, I understand that they've been working on this for a few years now
but I find it oddly alarming and hypocritical that Disney is able to
push their plan with almost zero resistance. Meanwhile, we cast members
have to fight to get better contracts or go to court and make disney
follow the law via measure L. I'm neither for or against disney forward,
I just wanted to give some food for thought.

Thank you,

â€ƒJoseph S.
