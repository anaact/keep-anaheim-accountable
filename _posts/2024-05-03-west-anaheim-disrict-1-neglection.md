title: West Anaheim district 1 neglection
---

While Disneyland is quite important, it is only fair to say west Anaheim
is completely neglected, and 39 Commons was never completed, so moving
on to other plans and districts development seem a bit premature.

May I add that we have waited for decades and decades for change?

Please, for heavens sake, finish what you start in district 1.

Sincerely,

â€ƒDISTRICT 1
