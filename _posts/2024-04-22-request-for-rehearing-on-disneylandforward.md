title: Request for rehearing on DisneylandForward
---

This request was filed with the City of Anaheim in April 2024.

**Applicable Grounds 2. There was not a fair hearing and the petitioner
was thereby deprived of any rights;**

1.  **Anaheim residents were denied adequate time to share their views
    when, what was promised to be, two separate Public Hearings were
    combined into one.** This reduced, by half, the time permitted to
    speak on the issues of street abandonments and the DisneylandForward
    project as a whole. It also deprived the public of the option to
    support the expansion project while opposing the abandonment of
    roads, despite Council acknowledgment that the road closures were a
    key issue for opponents of the project leading up to the April 16,
    2024 meeting.

    When the Public Hearing for the abandonment of streets was set
    during the City Council meeting of February 27, 2024, as Agenda Item
    24, several City Council members asked City staff about whether the
    street abandonment Public Hearing would be rolled into the
    DisneylandForward Public Hearing. Rudy Emami and Ted White both
    answered that the street abandonment would be a separate Public
    Hearing from the DisneylandForward Hearing. Ted White stated that
    both Public Hearings were being planned for the same date and
    meeting, but that there would be two separate Hearings to allow the
    public to share their views on each subject (see
    [video](https://anaheim.granicus.com/player/clip/3096?view_id=2&redirect=true)).

    1.  Two separate Public Hearings were critical to the exercise of
        rights by the public, as many speakers commenting on the
        DisneylandForward project in the weeks preceding the Public
        Hearing had expressed their desire to approve the project itself
        without the closure of Magic Way. By combining all agenda items
        into one Public Hearing, residents were left unable to oppose
        the closure of Magic Way without also opposing the
        DisneylandForward project.

    2.  Combining all subject matter into one Public Hearing also left
        the public with only 3 minutes to comment on both the expansion
        project and the closure of public roads. Review of the Public
        Comments portion of the meeting shows numerous residents running
        out of time prior to completing their thoughts.

2.  **Some Anaheim residents opposed to the project were denied a
    reasonable opportunity to speak altogether, due to the City of
    Anaheim's deliberate actions which deviated from past practice,
    making it physically impossible for some to retain their place in
    line to speak during Public Comments.** Seats inside of Council
    Chambers were reserved for City staff and Disney supporters. No
    accommodation appears to have been considered to make seating
    available for those residents within the Public Notice area. Those
    arriving at City Hall as early as 3 pm were left outside of the
    building. City staff failed to follow the usual practice of
    collecting Speaker Cards to reserve a speaking opportunity, and
    residents were forced to stand in line for hours to hold their
    respective places. Folding chairs had been "zip-tied" together,
    making it impossible to use the seating provided to sit while in
    line. No accommodation had been made for those with mobility issues
    who might be physically unable to stand in place for hours, nor was
    there accommodation to use the restroom without losing one's place.
    Due to this physical hardship, many speakers left without the
    opportunity to address the City Council, as shown by the number of
    speakers who did not appear at the microphone after being called by
    the City Clerk. Since the applicant had already reserved the
    majority of seats in Council Chambers for their own supporters, it
    stands to reason that leaving speakers outside City Hall would
    adversely affect those opposed to the project.

    There is a belief that this action may also have violated ADA
    requirements, but that is not the subject of this particular request
    for rehearing.

3.  **Members of the Anaheim City Council failed to act with
    disinterested zeal, indicating their reluctance to fairly consider
    testimony from those opposed to the project. Their dismissive
    indifference to the Public Comments was palpable and is
    well-documented through video recordings.**

    1.  During the allotted time for Public Comments, Mayor Aitken and
        members of the City Council spoke amongst themselves, laughed
        with each other, or departed from the Chambers, indicating they
        were not granting residents the equivalent attention offered to
        the applicant. Evidence of this is available in [video
        format](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-7kAeWy-a9w). Further
        evidence is available in the Granicus video record of the April
        16, 2024 meeting.

    2.  During the deliberative portion of the meeting, marked by
        timestamp 8:58:11 on the Granicus video, Councilmember Diaz made
        a lengthy statement in which he dismissed, without examination
        of evidence, a resident complaint regarding Deputy City Manager
        Ted White offering misinformation to the public. Councilmember
        Diaz failed to clarify or investigate the resident statement to
        determine whether incorrect information might have been
        presented to the public. Instead, Councilmember Diaz indicated
        extreme bias in favor of City staff to the exclusion of resident
        complaints;

        **Beginning at 8:58 time stamp on Granicus video**

        **Councilmember Jose Diaz:**

        > "A comment was made about Ted White that he lied. Ted, I know
        > your character, I know your integrity. Ted White did not lie
        > about anything here, in fact, I see City Manager s office
        > here, I see Finance, Public Works, Public Utilities, Fire,
        > Community Services, Economic Development, Housing. I put my
        > hands in the fire for you guys. I know your integrity, I know
        > who you are, you don 't deserve to be called corrupt, you don
        > t deserve to be called liars. You are not. You have a lot of
        > integrity and I stand by you. That's my first point."

**Applicable Grounds 3. There was a prejudicial abuse of discretion by
the City Council within the meaning of Section 1094.5 of the Code of
Civil Procedure of the State of California;**

1.  **City of Anaheim accepted/adopted all DisneylandForward-provided
    studies as being true and accurate. Independent appraisals/studies
    were not ordered or completed by the City of Anaheim for
    verification of information, in violation of City Policy.**

    1.  This failure is in direct violation of Council Policy 5.5, which
        states *"in any case where the Senior Real Property Agent finds
        that the fair market value of such property interest may exceed
        One Hundred Thousand Dollars (\$100,000.00), he or she shall
        order an independent M.A.1. appraisal of such property interest.
        The cost of any such appraisal shall be borne by the applicant
        and shall be deemed an obligation of the applicant due and owing
        to the City."*

        > The requirements of this policy shall not apply (1) to the

        >
        > Nothing contained in this policy shall prohibit the City
        > Council from waiving all or any portion of the compensation
        > payable to City hereunder, for good cause shown, to the extent
        > otherwise permitted by law.
        >
        > **Reference: Previous Council Policy 216**

    2.  **Council Policy 1.0 allows Council Policy to be waived only
        with a vote of the majority.** No such public vote happened,
        meaning the Council deviated from policy and standard procedure,
        indicating abuse of discretion by the Anaheim City Council.

2.  **The City of Anaheim may have engaged in ex-parte communication
    with the applicant, which denied the public opportunity to access
    and review the same evidence upon which the City Council based their
    approval of the project.**

    1.  The City of Anaheim accepted a 9-page Executive Summary of a
        CSUF economic study as the sole evidence to justify the economic
        benefits cited in the *"Finding of Fact and Statement of
        Overriding Consideration"* and as an integral part of the
        Environmental documents approved on April 16, 2024.
        Representatives of the City of Anaheim have stated they did not
        request the full CSUF report from Disney, nor did the City
        request a redacted version (or any version thereof). Instead,
        they operated with only the 9-page executive summary, which does
        not align with statements made by the applicant. This disparity
        in facts presented vs. evidence cited indicates the potential
        for ex-parte communication between the applicant and City
        leaders, resulting in the City Council members approving the
        project without providing all relevant information to the
        public.

    2.  At time stamp 9:13 in the Granicus video of the April 16, 2024
        meeting, Mayor Aitken engages in discussion with Disney's Ken
        Potrock, in which they discuss Disney's support for using ATID
        as an ongoing source of funding for housing, and a *"letter we
        hope to include in this public record,"* was noted. No such
        letter appears in the Agenda packet, disclosed for public review
        prior to the City Council meeting. ATID's enabling documents do
        not allow for such use of funds for housing. Nor has the use of
        ATID funding for "Community Benefits" related to
        DisneylandForward been publicly discussed or reviewed in
        documents available to the public.

3.  **Members of the City Council indicate they might not have examined
    all of the evidence, as they claimed to have done in the "Finding of
    Fact and Statement of Overriding Consideration."**

4.  **All of these points considered, the current council was willfully
    and grossly negligent in their respective duties. They acted as
    uninformed decision-makers, and failed in their duties to fairly
    represent the people of Anaheim with the disinterested zeal required
    of their offices.**
