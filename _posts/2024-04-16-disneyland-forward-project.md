title: Disneyland Forward project
---

Dear City Clerk:

First of all this whole item should be continued for at least 2 weeks to
communicate to more Anaheim Residents about this matter and gain greater
input.

Secondly, as part of any agreement of this project Anaheim and Disney
should agree to override and prior agreement not to charge a "Head Tax,"
"Patron tax,"Visitor Tax," or **"GATE TAX BAN."** A new agreement should be
agreed upon wherein Disney and the City of Anaheim agree upon a \$2.00
per person "Gate Tax" for benefit of the City of Anaheim for a duration
30 to 50 years. Said gate tax should include an annual escalator clause
to increase that tax tied to the rate of inflation or the Consumer Price
Index (CPI).

Agreeing to the Disneyland Forward project for \$100 million is nearly
meaningless. With a \$2.00 per head visitor tax, Anaheim can recover
that \$100 million in about 2-4 years. Disney is asking for an
increasing value asset over time in exchange for a fixed amount of an
asset (\$100 million) which will decrease or non-exist over time.

Anaheim should **not agree to anything without a \$2.00 Gate tax** which
increases the inflation rate.

Thank you,

 Neal R.
