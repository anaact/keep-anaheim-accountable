title: Delay Your Vote on the Disneyland Forward Project
---

I am writing to you as a concerned Orange County resident regarding the
proposed Disneyland Forward Project. I am deeply troubled by the
negative impacts that this project could have on our community and the
speed with which the city is moving forward to adopt this project
without proper community engagement

The expansion of the Disneyland Resort, as outlined in the
DisneylandForward proposal, raises significant concerns about community
displacement, traffic congestion, and strain on our public resources

I urge you to postpone the vote and ensure a detailed, open process that
carefully considers the Project's impact; encourages discussions between
city officials, Disney, and the community members; and ensures that the
community benefits associated with the project truly meet the proposed
benefits are in line with the community's needs for greater affordable
housing investments.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your
thoughtful consideration and action on behalf of the city.
